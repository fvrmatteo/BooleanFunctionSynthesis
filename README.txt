This repository contains binaries and implementations of Boolean 
function synthesis algorithms described in the papers 
"Skolem Functions for Factored Formulas" in FMCAD'15 and 
"Towards Parallel Boolean Functional Synthesis" in TACAS'17. 

This folder contains,

bin/: binaries parSyn and SkolemFunctionGenerator
src/: source files
scripts/: a sample pbs script
INSTALL.txt: installation instructions
HOW-TO-EXECUTE.txt: instructions to execute parSyn and SkolemFunctionGenerator

Benchmarks used in FMCAD'15 can be found at https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~supratik/tools/fmcad_2015_experiments/benchmarks/

Benchmarks used in TACAS'17 can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwmvCTZAETPvN1ZvSktZRmo1Uzg
