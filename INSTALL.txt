These are the installation instructions for parSyn (Parallel Boolean Function
Synthesis Tool), and SkolemFunctionGenerator (Sequential Boolean Function 
Synthesis Tool). 

Prerequisites: ABC tool (from http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/) is a 
	       prerequisite for both parSyn and SkolemFunctionGenerator. 

	       For installing parSyn, mpic++ (from https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v1.8/man1/mpic++.1.php)
	       and Boost library (from http://www.boost.org) are also needed. 
	       We need the library Boost.mpi in Boost library (note that Boost.mpi 
	       needs to be installed explicitly during installation of Boost.)

To install parSyn and SkolemFunctionGenerator, 
1) cd src/
2) Ensure that the variables ABC_PATH, LIBS, B_INCLUDE, and BOOST_MPI_LIBS are 
   properly set in Makefile.  
3) do make

This creates the binaries parSyn and SkolemFunctionGenerator inside bin/
